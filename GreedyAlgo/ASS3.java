/*Q3. There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].You 
have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i]‚Äù of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 
1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.Given two integer arrays 
gas and cost, return the starting gas station s index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise 
direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.  */
